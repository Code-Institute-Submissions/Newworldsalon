Welcome zappy_emem,

Second Milestone Project Newworldsalon
Project's Name – Newworldsalon

Newworldsalon is a personal real-life project that I intend to start-up by December 2020. It is a beauty shop located in the heart of Stockholm. The goal is to redefine the outer beauty that brings out the inner beauty in our clients by meeting the needs of people. A place were men, women and children can have a fresh hair cut and styles. The salon provides different services that could help satisfy clients beauty and looks. 

A brief project method:

            As mentioned earlier the aim of the project is to help promote cleanliness, healthy and smart look. Looking refreshed attracts good companies. My passion is driven from my love for hair, make-up, looking clean and good. As the saying goes “Cleanliness is next to godliness”. Also is my passion to see people looking nice and presentable for work, meetings and  social life. I feel starting up a salon will give me a platform help contribute to healthy living and longer life span. 

           After going through my first milestone project and JS, I have gathered some knowledge on how to design a simple website like this. I have also watched lots of tutorials and got the section designs from looking at different Salon website sites. Further details about the project are given below.

- Gallery: This section is designed to to reassure the user that they are making the right choice to come to us. Pictures of samples of haircuts and styles are displayed to showcase examples of work previously done. To build clients confidence. This way we can build the trust 
of our clients even before they finally become our members.

Another future idea:
•	Password reset by email: gmail setting required when/if site is finally deployed to be in use which is not relevant now. 
•	In the home section I hope to have a link to quickly make a booking.
•	To also add more information in the home section and more pictures to the gallery

   Testing:
   
   This project is a static one which makes some of its features difficult to test as future work needs to be done. However, the links on the navbar to the the sections have been tested and funtions well.
   Every link takes you to the right sections. the home page keep the user on the first section since it is the homepage. Though I am aware the homepage on the navbar could be deleted since it takes the user no 
   where other than the first page that could be seen already. The reason why is there is to let them know that is the Homepage. Every sections have been tested to ensure they all work well as intended.

   The pictures works fine on the different sactions including the background pictures. 
   All links used for icons and buttons are tested to function well for the user experirnce to be achieved. Every details have been provided to give the user a straightforward
   guidance towards achieving their goals.
