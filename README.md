# Second Milestone Project Newworldsalon

**Project's Name – Newworldsalon**

Newworldsalon is a personal real-life project that I intend to start-up by December 2020. It is a beauty shop located in the heart of Stockholm. The goal is to redefine the outer beauty that brings out the inner beauty in our clients by meeting the needs of people. A place were men, women and children can have a fresh hair cut and styles. The salon provides different services that could help satisfy clients beauty and looks. 

**A brief project method:**

As mentioned earlier the aim of the project is to help promote cleanliness, healthy and smart look. Looking refreshed attracts good companies. My passion is driven from my love for hair, make-up, looking clean and good. As the saying goes “Cleanliness is next to godliness”. Also is my passion to see people looking nice and presentable for work, meetings and  social life. I feel starting up a salon will give me a platform help contribute to healthy living and longer life span. 

After going through my first milestone project and JS, I have gathered some knowledge on how to design a simple website like this. I have also watched lots of tutorials and got the section designs from looking at different Salon website sites. Further details about the project are given below.

<img src="pictures/gallery1.png">

**Gallery:** This section is designed to to reassure the user that they are making the right choice to come to us. Pictures of samples of haircuts and styles are displayed to showcase examples of work previously done. To build clients confidence. This way we can build the trust 
of our clients even before they finally become our members. 

<img src="pictures/booking1.png">
<img src="pictures/booking2.png">

**Booking:** This section allows the client to make a booking for an appiontment. The first step is to register and become a member in the salon. From the next time it becomes more easy to book for subsequent appiontment with the already created username and password. These can also be retrieved when forgotten. Customers would receive confirmation messages in their emails.

<img src="pictures/About.png">

**About:**  This section is to provide the users with more nformation about the salon. Its aim and why they should choose to style their hair at Newworld.

<img src="pictures/contact.png">

**Contact:** This section is very important and is designed to enable users contact us. The map shows the pointers to the two different branches in Stockholm. They can as well share their thoughts on any matter and ask for more informations. They can also give feedbacks.

***More on the Contact page:***

1. The contact page contains a form for the user to fill in to send the salon an email address.

2. Name, email address and message are all required fields so that the shop owner receives all the information she needs to respond.

3. If the user has logged in, then their email address will be registered in the email field.

4. When the user clicks "send" the email is processed and sent via email to The Newworldsalon's email address.
          

<img src="pictures/Footer.png">

**Footer:** The footer section is designed to create an opportunity for easy interaction with users through our various soacial media links, show a quick display of our location contact number and most importantly the opening time of the salon.     

# Another future idea:

•	Password reset by email: gmail setting required when/if site is finally deployed to be in use which is not relevant now. 

•	In the home section I hope to have a link to quickly make a booking.

•	To also add more information in the home section and more pictures to the gallery

•	To add the opening time in the About section

**Icons:**

There are some icons on the images I intend to use in the future which is why I left them. The icons are in two sizes one big(2x) and one small. 
Information about the membership booking forms. 
In the booking forms section, the idea is to provide a membership platform where users can register to become members by filling out several details. Then subsequently they can easily make their booking. This was the initial plan which I changed considering the need for a data base to store the data that would be provided (cloud). In the future I hope to add this part since this website would actually be hosted live and running for my future business.
